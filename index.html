    <p>
        I am 28, was born and raised in a small city called TrÃªs Marias, Brazil. When I was 17, I moved out for studying
        <em>electrical engeneering</em>,
        and so discovered a passion for programming. Once my
        <em>masters degree</em>
        was accomplished, I am finally free to follow the path of a
        <strong>Web Developer</strong>, starting as student at <strong>Trybe</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Trybe is a great school, that teaches not only the <strong>programming skills</strong> but also the
        <strong>soft-skills</strong>
        that a <em>dev</em> must have to be successful. Besides that, Trybe offers to its students the possibility of
        not starting paying for the course until he or she gets a job in the area for at least R$ 3000 per month. And
        more than 90% of the students accomplish that after until 3 month after graduate. That's awesome! More details
        about that can be seen
        <a href="https://www.betrybe.com/">here</a>.
    </p>

        <h2>Qualities</h2>
    </p>

    <p id="qualities">
        As feedback of the selection process of Trybe, I received a very faithful report from Mindsight, that summarizes
        some qualities of mine which I am proud of. They are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Analytical capacity</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Conceptual thinking
        </li>
        <li>
            Creative thinking
        </li>
        <li>
            Planning and organization
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Hard working
            </strong>
            is also a qualitie of mine, that Mindsight doesn't measure.
        </li>
    </ul>
